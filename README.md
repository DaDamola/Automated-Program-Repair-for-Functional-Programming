# Automated Program Repair for Functional Programming

Automated program repair resolves errors in application programs autonomously. The goal of the project was to provide a basis for constructing training data that can be used to improve the performance of APR tools. This basis contains a corpus of common programming errors. It was created in the form of a new construct called programming error triples. Programming error triples are made up of these three things: a formal description of the exercise the program is meant to solve, a correct version of the program that follows the description, and an incorrect version of the program that contains an error. This repo contains the programming error triples created in the functional programming language, Scheme, and the analysis of the project discussed in the literature survey.
